     `TRTCVoice` is a terminatable singleton.
     In the demo, a singleton object can be obtained or generated through `shardInstance` (OC) or `shared` (Swift)
     After terminating the singleton object, you need to call the `sharedInstance` API again to generate the instance again.
     This method is called in `VoiceRoomListRoomViewModel`, `CreateVoiceRoomViewModel`, and `VoiceRoomViewModel`
     Since it is a terminatable singleton, the purpose of generating and placing the object here is to manage the singleton generation path in a unified way and facilitate maintenance
